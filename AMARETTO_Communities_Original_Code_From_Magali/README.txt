## ** Community AMARETTO ** ##

This repository contains Magali's code for the EBioMedicine PanCancer AMARETTO study, almost but not quite compatible with the AMARETTO code on BitBucket.

The files ending in "_compatible_with_AMARETTO.R" have been tweaked (via the required variable name changes) to work with the AMARETTO output structure produced by the code on BitBucket.

These files are a bunch of R scripts, we should soon replace them with an initial R package, and then base further development of Community AMARETTO on that.
